## Choreography
### The User

A User should start at the home page. Then, if they are new and learning about us the About page 
should be next to give them a greater understanding of what we do. 
Next is the real cream of the crop: the edition of the week. This is where the User will ideally spend a god chunk of time, 
before moving on to the survey page if they are interested in the aim.

Alternatively, a User could move from the home page to the survey page, given that the link is in the terminal area and this might attract them a lot. After this, they are free to access the article page or about page.

### The Admin
To access the backend, an admin should start from Home and go to the Sign Up page. At the bottom of the sign up page, the link **Admin** will re-direct to the database.
